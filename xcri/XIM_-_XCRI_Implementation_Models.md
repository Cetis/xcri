XIM: XCRI Implementation Models Project
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


Introduction 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XIM is a
[JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ "http://www.jisc.ac.uk/")-funded mini-project that will produce a set of good practice
models for implementation of XCRI-CAP, so that HEIs and others can use
the outputs for their own implementations. The project will review all
current implementations and projects relating to the XCRI information
model, together with existing material about institutional courses
information management systems, in order to draw up characteristics of
institutions, to identify relevant problems and solutions. The main
project outcome is to provide practical solutions for take up by HEIs
and others.

The final report for the XIM project is

Aim 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project aims to help HEIs and other organisations to implement
XCRI-CAP driven services to facilitate the exchange and re-use of course
advertising information.


Outcomes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main project outcome is to promote the use of XCRI-CAP to
organisations using, collecting and disseminating course advertising
information, by providing practical business-driven solutions. The
project will produce a series of generic business process templates for
organisations to use by matching their own characteristics with those
modelled, in order to identify common problems and solutions.


Requirements and Deliverables 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project will investigate the usage of XCRI-CAP in HEIs and data
collecting organisations, building on earlier XCRI work, including the
XCRI-CAP mini-projects, APS' work for GMSA within the ioNW2 Project and
initial work with Hotcourses, Ufi and UCAS. The organisations'
management of course advertising information will be described through
assessing their position on a variety of scales, for example:

-   Technical infrastructure
-   Process maturity
-   Development of courses information management
-   Expertise in implementing a service oriented approach

The project will deliver:

-   A characterisation of organisational use of course
    advertising information.
-   Scenarios and business process models for use of XCRI-CAP within
    common points in the characterisation.
-   Descriptions of common problems and solutions, dependent on
    organisational characteristics. These will address specifically ICT,
    political and process problems, and will include a description of
    the pre-requisites for successful implementation, dependent on the
    type of organisation - HEI, other educational establishment, data
    collecting organisation - and its characteristics.
-   A service genre for submission to the e-Framework on publishing
    and/or exchanging course advertising information

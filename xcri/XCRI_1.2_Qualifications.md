===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================




Editor's NoteThis is the model used for Qualification elements in
XCRI 1.2 separated out for possible future submission to CEN




\[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=2.html "Edit section: Foreword")\] Foreword
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Educational Qualification Information Model has as its background
the identified need to represent qualification information in multiple
metadata specifications, including information about learning
opportunities, diplomas, and transcripts of results for units of
learning.


\[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=3.html "Edit section: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS")\] ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=4.html "Edit section: Introduction")\] Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the \[EQF\], qualifications represent: ‚Äúthe formal
outcome of an assessment and validation process which is obtained when a
competent body determines that an individual has achieved learning
outcomes to given standards‚Äù. The Guidelines of European Learner
Mobility (CEN-LMAI\] defines qualification as ‚Äústatus awarded to or
conferred on a learner by an awarding body‚Äù.

In use, the term qualification can be used to mean either the
specification of a qualification (e.g. the qualification that can be
obtained as a result of successfully completing a learning opportunity)
or the award conferred upon a learner. In the context of this standard,
qualification is used only in the former sense of the specification of
qualifications.

However, this does not preclude the use of this standard along with
other information to represent individual achievement, for example by
reference from an individual achievement record to the description of
the qualification obtained as part of the specification of the learning
opportunity that they undertook.

This standard defines a common information model for representing
educational qualifications that can be used either as part of a larger
information model or standard, or as standalone definitions.


\[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=5.html "Edit section: Scope")\] Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This standard defines the semantics of classes and properties used to
represent descriptions of qualifications in electronic form.

The definitions in this standard are primarily intended to be referenced
by other bindings, specifications, and standards; for example,
specifications representing learning opportunities and units of
learning, or specifications representing learner achievements.


\[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=6.html "Edit section: Conformance")\] Conformance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=7.html "Edit section: Conforming Instances")\] Conforming Instances

A strictly conforming instance is a set of structured information
constituted only of objects and statements defined by the classes and
properties of this standard and/or fully qualified refinements of the
classes and properties defined in this standard.

NOTE: As there are no cardinality restrictions on any of the properties
of this standard, an instance consisting only of one or more objects
conforming to classes defined in this standard but without any
properties is a strictly conforming instance.

A conforming instance is a set of structured information that includes
at least one object or statement defined by the classes and properties
of this standard, or at least one fully qualified refinement of a class
or property defined in this standard. A conforming instance may contain
any number of additional objects and properties not defined by this
standard.

NOTE: Any information set that contains a statement conforming to this
standard is therefore a conforming instance; for example, an XML
document containing an element that conforms to the specification of a
property defined in this standard is a conforming instance.

A fully qualified refinement is defined for the purpose of conformance
as a property that explicitly extends a property defined by this
standard. A fully qualified refinement must be capable of being
processed according to the semantics of the property it extends.


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=8.html "Edit section: Conforming Bindings")\] Conforming Bindings

A strictly conforming binding is constituted only of bindings to an
exchange format of the classes and properties defined by this standard
and fully qualified refinements of the properties defined in this
standard.

A conforming binding may contain additional properties that do not
necessarily extend or map to the properties defined in this standard.

NOTE: For example, a binding of \[CEN-MLO\] that uses the properties of
this standard for the content of the MLO ‚Äòqualification‚Äô property is
also a conforming binding of this standard.

Both strictly conforming bindings and conforming bindings must be
capable of generating and validating instances that can be automatically
converted to a strictly conforming instance of this standard.

Both strictly conforming bindings and conforming bindings may impose
additional constraints upon the values of properties defined in this
standard.

Both strictly conforming bindings and conforming bindings may impose
cardinality constraints on properties defined in this standard.


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=9.html "Edit section: Conforming Applications")\] Conforming Applications

A conforming application must have at least one of the following
capabilities:

1\. Generating conforming instances and/or instances conforming to a
conforming binding

2\. Processing conforming instances, and/or instances that conform to a
conforming binding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is non-normative, and for guidance purposes only.


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=18.html "Edit section: Education Levels and Frameworks")\] Education Levels and Frameworks

Levels of qualifications are usually expressed in the context of a
qualification framework, for example the European Qualifications
Framework \[EQF\].

Rather than use a single integer or text for the EducationLevel
property, implementers are encouraged to make use of Uniform Resource
Identifiers \[IETF-RFC2396\] to identify both the level of the
qualification and the framework from which the level is derived. For
example, \[CWA XXXXX\] defines EQF levels using the form:



Where n is the number of the EQF level.

Other frameworks for which a standard URI is not defined may be
represented using a similar convention, whereby the URL of the framework
precedes the level value separated using a URI fragment identifier. For
example, the following would represent level 5 of the Scottish Credit
and Qualifications Framework:




### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=19.html "Edit section: Identifiers and Frameworks")\] Identifiers and Frameworks

Identifiers of qualifications are usually expressed in the context of a
qualification framework. Where identifiers are given, implementations
are encouraged to use refinements of the identifier property for
particular identifier schemes. For example, an identifier for a
qualification issued according to the UK‚Äôs Qualification Accreditation
Number \[UK-QAN\] system might be represented by:

&lt;identifier xsi:type="qca:qan"&gt;50049422&lt;/identifier&gt;


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=20.html "Edit section: Alternative language representations")\] Alternative language representations

Bindings may wish to use a language tag, such as xml:lang, to indicate
alternative equivalent natural language versions of properties, such as
title and description.


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=21.html "Edit section: Composite qualifications")\] Composite qualifications

Qualifications may be composed from other qualifications using the
hasPart and isPartOf associations. Such composition may be by reference
or by value depending on the binding used. Processing guidelines for
implementers This section is non-normative, and for guidance purposes
only.

In general, implementations should follow the specification of a
conforming binding; these guidelines may be followed by implementations
where no rules for treating the behaviour are specified in the binding.
No Awarded By or Accredited By Associations Where there are no Awarded
By or Accredited By properties for an instance of Qualification, an
implementation may assume that the qualification is awarded by and
accredited by the organisation that offers the learning opportunity that
the qualification is associated with. However it is up to
implementations to determine a reasonable business rule.


### \[[edit](../index.php@title=XCRI_1.2_Qualifications&action=edit&section=22.html "Edit section: Multiple education levels")\] Multiple education levels

Where multiple values are given for level in an instance:

1\. Ignore any refinements of the education level property and accept
only an unqualified level property, if exactly one exists in the
instance. 2. Where levels are represented as URIs, infer the appropriate
level to use from the URIs. 3. Treat the instance as being in error.

NOTE: Instances may use refinements of the level property to encode

\[[edit](../index.php@title=Interoperable_Subject_Vocabulary_Service&action=edit&section=1.html "Edit section: Introduction")\]  Introduction 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the inception of the XCRI strand of work there has been an
increasing expectation that XCRI will address vocabularies, particularly
subject vocabularies, even though this is not directly within its remit.
A common method of searching across repositories of learning
opportunities has been the ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô of course information
systems, so that learners do not have to grapple with different search
mechanics in otherwise very similar systems. The project will take a
sample subject area from several subject classification systems and
lists of keywords and map them to a common spine vocabulary, probably
the Learndirect Classification System. It will develop a web-based
demonstrator of the full service, and a working prototype for the sample
subject area. The prototype will show how a user can select a search
term from a keyword list or subject classification system and obtain
search results from a different keyword list or classification system
used in the course information system. The project will investigate and
compare the quality of results using the ‚Äònative‚Äô system and the
enhanced subject search service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ASAP prototype is published
[here](http://www.xxp.org/asap_prototype/ "http://www.xxp.org/asap_prototype/"){.external
.text}. For a demonstration, please contact Alan Paull at
alan@alanpaull.co.uk.

The approach of the ASAP search is to map XCRI-CAP format courses onto
the system's bespoke thesaurus using many classification systems and
keyword lists. By using a number of different classification methods
ASAP provides both a common, generic approach to mapping courses onto
the thesaurus and a tailored approach for institution and even course
specific mappings. As each course file is imported into the ASAP system,
it is matched against the relevant thesaurus terms using one or more of
the classification systems, and the thesaurus term is added to the
course record.

When a user searches using ASAP, they begin by entering a search term.
That search term is then compared to the thesaurus and used as an 'entry
point' into the structure of the thesaurus. The system then follows each
relationship through the thesaurus to build a specific 'sub-thesaurus'
for that search term. The sub-thesaurus is then used to query the
courses held in the database, and all courses linked to the nodes within
the sub-thesaurus are retrieved. Each course is tagged with its
relationship to the original search term node, and scored depending on
its relevance and distance from the original node. The resulting data
set is then returned for presentation to the user.

We have provided a
[script](http://www.xxp.org/asap_prototype/asap_script.pdf "http://www.xxp.org/asap_prototype/asap_script.pdf"){.external
.text} that users can follow to see the ASAP mechanism and to compare it
with conventional subject searching.

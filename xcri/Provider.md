\[[edit](../index.php@title=Provider&action=edit&section=2.html "Edit section: Guidance Notes")\] Guidance Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Identifiers**: A Provider SHOULD have a default unique identifier
formatted as a URL (e.g. ""). Additional
identifiers in other formats may be used, but SHOULD be qualified using
xsi:type to a specific identifier namespace. An example would include
the UK provider reference number (UKPRN) within the UKRLP:UKPRN
namespace. See the [identifier](Identifier.html "Identifier") definition
for more details.

**Title**: a Provider SHOULD have a title.

**Description**: A Provider SHOULD have a description, generally a small
amount of generic information about the provider.

If a delta update pattern is being used, the
[recstatus](Recstatus.html "Recstatus") attribute can alert an
aggregator to a change in provider details. Whenever
[recstatus](Recstatus.html "Recstatus") is used, provider.identifier
must contain a persistent, unique identifier, so that an aggregator can
identify what has changed, as well as how it has changed (addition,
modification or deletion).

**Street**, **Town** and **Postcode**: It is recommended that these are
included in the provider information.

**Url**: A Provider SHOULD have a URL for its homepage, or its
applications microsite, in addition to its primary domain identifier
(see above).

**Course**: In almost all cases there SHOULD be at least one course for
a provider. The capability for supporting zero courses is offered for
cases where XCRI CAP is used to format course search results.


\[[edit](../index.php@title=Provider&action=edit&section=3.html "Edit section: History")\] History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**v1.1**: Since v1.0 the common metadata for providers, courses, and
other resources was rationalized. This means quite a few minor changes.
In particular, elements that were mandatory or single in v1.0 are now
mostly optional and multiple.
